Followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/1r-F3FIONl8) by WDS to get stripe working. I went ahead and did server side rendering all the HTML, but if I end up wanting the client to be separate from the server, he details that at the end of his video..

I deployed it using [Google Cloud Platform App Engine](https://youtu.be/uEVmD6n8Il0?t=248), which is actually pretty nice and I think free tier will get me everything I need.

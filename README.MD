# less-is-more - Less is more!

### Money doesn't buy happiness so donate it instead!

Followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/1r-F3FIONl8) by WDS to get stripe working. I went ahead and did server side rendering all the HTML, but if I end up wanting the client to be separate from the server, he details that at the end of his video.

### Installation

```
npm i
touch .env # Then fill with proper contents (See `.env.example`)
```

<!-- Note: Be sure to fill the `.env` file with proper contents based on the `.env.example` file. -->
